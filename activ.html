                I have a lot of hobbies, and there are a number of hobbies I want to get into. 
                For one I run track, which is a lot more difficult than people make it out ot be. 
                Track taught me a lot of things, and by track I mean my coach.

                    Ask yourselves "Am I there yet?" 
                    Am I ready to compete, 
                    Am I ready to give my all, not just what you consider your best!
                    There's more to you, you have to dig down deep to find the "Fuel" your reasons why this is important.
                    From here on out no more I can't, I'm going to do better!! Is our theme. 
                    Embrace the glory of our success story because it resides in the work you put in. 
                    Adversity builds character. 
                    Achieving sparks believing.
                    Out working doubts builds confidence. 
                    Be the best version of yourself now. 
                    I'm for you, do it for yourself and everything else you desire will follow.
