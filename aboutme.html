                    Hello there, my name is Praise Moses. <br>
                    Ever since I was little I've been taking things apart and trying to put them back together. 
                    It started with pens, and advanced to furniture and at some point it was my old computer. 
                    I love working backwards to solve a problem especially when something go wrong or dosen't work like it should.
                    I think that's where my love for technology first started which is why I applied for the Nextech internship. 
                    I was accepted into the program and got to experience so many diferent things.
                    I was taught about computer science, and learned different coding languages, and hear people in the industry speak.
                    I had taken engineering classes before, but they were more builidng focused than coding.
                    I'm really grateful for the internship because it opened my eyes to the options I have.
