                    For the longest time I had a general idea of what I wanted to do with my life, but I never knew specificallly what I wanted. 
                    Sophmore year of highschool changed me for better or worse, I can't tell, but it made me sit down and seriously think about my future.
                    I debated which career I wanted to go into because I want to code but I also wanted to building things.
                    So I created a list of of mostly engineering fields that I thought I wanted to go into. Thanks to Catapult though I learned I like to code a lot more than I like to build.
                    So begins my computer science journey, I'm still debating what specific field I want to go into but I have a list!
                    I just started this journey so I can't say much but once graduation comes I'm sure I'll be able to tell you a lot more.
